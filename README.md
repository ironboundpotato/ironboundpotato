# 👋 Hey, I’m Kevin Gilbert (TB)  
### **AI Systems Operator | Framework Architect | Story Engineer | Blue-Collar Builder**

I’m a machinist-turned-AI systems operator building **Ironbound Lab** — a set of drift-proof protocols, cognitive frameworks, and multi-model orchestration tools designed to stabilize advanced LLM workflows.

I work in the real world (industrial laser operator by day) and build advanced AI systems on breaks, lunch, and between cuts.  
My work blends **engineering mindset**, **psychology**, **narrative logic**, and **LLM mechanics** into a single operator discipline.

## 🔥 What I Build

### **🛡️ Six-Demon Drift Architecture (v1.1)**  
A diagnostic system for identifying and correcting the six primary failure modes of modern AI:
- Role Drift  
- Tone Drift  
- Format Drift  
- Intent Drift  
- Scope Drift  
- Confidence Drift  

This architecture is the backbone of my multi-model stabilization work.

### **⚙️ Ironbound Lockstep Protocol**  
A multi-agent orchestration pipeline coordinating:
- GPT — Architect  
- Claude — Logic Officer  
- Grok — Stress Tester  
- Gemini — Cross-Check & Polisher  

Designed to keep outputs **coherent, aligned, and drift-free** across long projects.

### **🧠 The Internal Physics of Being Alive**  
A cognitive-structural system describing:
- pressure  
- load-bearing meaning  
- distortion  
- cracking  
- redistribution  

Used across storytelling, character logic, mental models, and AI reasoning.
