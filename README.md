# 👋 Hey, I’m Kevin Gilbert (TB)  
### **AI Systems Operator | Framework Architect | Story Engineer | Midwestern Builder**

I’m a Midwestern machinist and father who creates in the margins of his life — between laser cuts, on lunch breaks, and after the world goes quiet.  
What I build isn’t code or apps.  
I build **systems**: tools for controlling drift, structuring thought, stabilizing AI, and telling stories that hold weight.

My work blends **blue-collar discipline**, **psychology**, **engineering logic**, and **LLM behavior** into a single operator practice.

# 🔥 What I Build

## **🛡️ Six-Demon Drift Architecture (v1.1)**  
A diagnostic structure for identifying and correcting the six primary destabilization modes in AI:

- Role Drift  
- Tone Drift  
- Format Drift  
- Intent Drift  
- Scope Drift  
- Confidence Drift  

This is the backbone of my operator discipline.

## **⚙️ Ironbound Lockstep Protocol**  
A multi-agent AI orchestration method assigning fixed roles to each model:

- **GPT** — Architect  
- **Claude** — Logic Officer / Editor  
- **Grok** — Stress Tester  
- **Gemini** — Cross-Check & Polisher  

Built to keep long-form, multi-model workflows **coherent, aligned, and drift-free**.

## **🧠 The Internal Physics of Being Alive**  
A cognitive framework describing human behavior as a system of:

- pressure  
- load-bearing meaning  
- distortion  
- cracking  
- access  
- redistribution  

Used for narrative logic, character psychology, trauma architecture, and AI reasoning.

# ⚡ Personal Line  
My background is industrial and my instincts are structural.  
I build systems, stories, and a life for my daughter the same way I run a machine —  
**with steadiness, discipline, and the refusal to break under pressure.**
